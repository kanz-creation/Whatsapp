# WhatsappMERN

This is a whatsapp chat clone. This was bulit using the MERN Stack. 
In the front end folder, we can see that the front end was bootstrapped with create-react. 

In the back end folder, I have used Express, Node and MongoDB. I have also used Pusher to update the database in real time. All previous messages are loaded into the chatroom, and the user can send any message. 

Steps to run the application:

  Frontend: 
  - cd whatapp 
  - npm start 
  
  Backend: 
  - cd whatsapp-backend
  - nodemon server.js
